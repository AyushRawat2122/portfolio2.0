  about: `I’m a Computer Science student and aspiring Full-Stack Developer passionate about building scalable, user-focused web applications.
          With hands-on experience in React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean architecture, optimized APIs, and modern UI design.
          I’m currently strengthening my Data Structures & Algorithms foundation while contributing to projects that combine performance with functionality — like Muzox, a full-stack music app, and Todoshi, a real-time team collaboration platform.
          Driven by curiosity and growth, I aim to join a dynamic team where I can apply my technical skills, learn from experienced developers, and build products that make an impact.`,
